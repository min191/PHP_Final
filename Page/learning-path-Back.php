            Most websites or mobile applications have two parts: Front-end and Back-end. The front-end is the
            part of the user interface that is visible and interactable. The back-end is where data is processed and
            stored.
            Therefore, the Back-end programmer's task is to analyze and design data and process business logic of
            functions in the application. </p>
