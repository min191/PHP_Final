        <h1>WELCOME TO Database</h1>
        <p>
        Most websites and mobile applications have two parts: the front-end and the back-end.
         The front-end is the user interface, while the back-end processes and stores data.
         In the back-end, databases are essential for storing and managing application data.
          Back-end developers design the database structure and implement business logic to
           ensure data integrity. They use languages like SQL to perform operations such as querying and updating data,
            enabling dynamic content and real-time responses in applications. </p>

        <h2>1. SQL</h2>
        <p>To learn back-end web development, we start with SQL. SQL (Structured Query Language)
             is essential for managing and manipulating data in databases, allowing developers to store, 
             retrieve, and update information for dynamic web applications.</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td class="image-cell"><img src="../img/Courses/sql.jpg" alt="SQL" /></td>
                <td class="info">
                    <p>SQL</p>
                    <p>SQL is a powerful language for database management. 
                        With its ability to query, update, and manipulate data,
                         it helps you build dynamic web applications and manage data efficiently.
                          Learning SQL is a great step for working with robust databases!</p>

            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>2. XML and JSON</h2>
        <p>
        To learn back-end web development, it’s important to understand XML and JSON.
         Both are data interchange formats used to store and transmit data between a server and a client.
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td class="image-cell"><img src="../img/Courses/XML and JSON.jpg" alt="XML and JSON" /></td>
                <td class="info">
                    <p>XML and JSON</p>
                    <p>Learning XML and JSON is ideal for beginners
                         who are new to data interchange formats. With plenty of resources
                          available, you’ll discover how to structure and transmit data effectively
                           for web applications. Understanding XML and JSON is an excellent way to 
                           enhance your skills in handling data exchange between servers and clients!</p>

        </table>

        <h2>3. NoSQL Query Languages</h2>
        <p>
        Various languages and APIs used with NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra)
         that allow for flexible data storage and retrieval.
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td class="image-cell"><img src="../img/Courses/NoSQL Query Languages.jpg" alt="NoSQL Query Languages" /></td>
                <td class="info">
                    <p>NoSQL Query Languages</p>
                    <p>NoSQL query languages are essential for working with non-relational databases.
                         They help you store and manage unstructured or semi-structured data efficiently.
                          With NoSQL, you can easily retrieve, update, and manipulate information for applications 
                          that require flexibility and scalability. Learning NoSQL query languages is crucial for 
                          modern web and software development.</p>
